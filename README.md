# scripts-windows
Collection of general scripts for windows

## What is it?
These are intended to be put in a general folder grouping that can be added to the Path system environment variable.
Then, (powershell) can easily figure things out and handle simple tasks rather than loading bookmarks / finding files / etc. 

## Security Note 
As a public repo, you probably shouldn't add random github repos to your path variable. Instead, you may want to manually copy somewhere where a pull could bring in a new file that you unintentionally run.
