# scripts-windows
Collection of general scripts for windows. I usually use Bash, but on Windows I'm testing if I can bring Powershell up to par. Powershell / CMD were chosen because no additional installs are needed. Sending someone a python script would probably be great, but it also would require them to want and have python installed. 

## What is it?
These are intended to be put in a general folder grouping that can be added to the Path system environment variable.
Your terminal can then easily figure things out from scripts you feed in, allowing it to handle simple tasks rather than loading bookmarks / finding files / etc. 

## Security Practice Note 
As a public repo, you probably shouldn't add random github repos to your path variable. Instead, you may want to manually copy the scripts you want somewhere where a pull couldn't accidentally bring in a new file that you unintentionally run.
